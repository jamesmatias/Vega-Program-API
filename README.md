Vega Program API Examples

apiconstants.php - is used to store your library specific information:
API URL and API Key

functions.php - includes some basic php functions to retrieve a list of events
as well as event details. These do not need to be modified to work, but you
can edit and extend them as necessary once you are comfortable working with
the API.
